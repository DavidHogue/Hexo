I swear this is the last post I'm writing for a while on the topic of blogging. Really!

It took me a while, but I finally merged the content from my old blog to this one. It wasn't too hard since they're both WordPress. Just export and then import. The parts that took the longest were finding a way to exclude the old posts from the RSS feed and setting up permanent redirects for all the posts and feeds.

Hopefully the transition goes smoothly from here on out. I'll be watching my logs, stats, and webmaster tools over the next few days to make sure.

So now I need to get to writing some real content. There's a lot of old (and probably outdated) content here now and I need to get it more up to date.
