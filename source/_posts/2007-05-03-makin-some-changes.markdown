This is mostly a test post.  If you can see it then it appears everything is working.  I've been changing things up around here lately.  I've changed my blogs url from vorpal.cc/blog to blog.vorpal.cc, I've removed a bunch of categories, I reinstalled WordPress...

All my old urls should have permanent redirects to the new ones.  If you find any broken links, I'd appreciate it if you would leave a comment.

I haven't written much lately.  I've been meaning to, but I have just been so busy.  One of the things that kept me from writing here was that up until now, most of my posts are about .net development and I think most of my readers are here because of that.  That's great, but it kind of made me post less non-.net stuff because I didn't want to get off track or fill their newsreaders with boring stuff that has nothing to do with software development.

So, what I've done is consolidated my categories and I put a link to a category specific feed for each one.  If you just want to read about what I have to say on .net and don't want the extra noise you can subscribe to the [software development feed](http://blog.vorpal.cc/category/category/development/feed/) and ignore the rest.  If you want everything, the same old feed should work assuming your feed reader listens to the redirects (here's the [new feed url just in case](http://blog.vorpal.cc/feed/)).

Anyway, hopefully I'll find the time to add more to this silly blog some day.
