Another time I made a change to remove redundancy in configuration files, long after the change has been in production I get asked if we do things with a whole new framework. I respond that we tweaked it a little bit a while back to make things easier. And then they ask me if I'm angry.

I just don't get it sometimes.

Maybe I need to reiterate my concerns and explicitly say what I plan to do, if anything, about them. Then again, when I do bring up things they just fall through the cracks. And I'm not saying my code is perfect either, there's some ugly workarounds that are just necessary sometimes.

Perhaps it's because I view the code as fluid. Something that is always in progress and while it will never be perfect, the more we work on it the closer it will get. Maybe others don't hold this view. To them the code is a completed sculpture cast in stone. Changes are viewed as a waste of time at best and an error at worst.
