Another year came and went already.  I had a lot of fun in 2007 and I'm excited about the next year.  

There's a lot of interesting things coming up in the .net world: .net 3.5 and Visual Studio 2008 are finally out, the ASP.NET MVC framework is looking good, the ALT.NET stuff is giving some attention to non-Microsoft tools.  I've been working on some interesting stuff for a while now that should get some use soon.

I'm not really much for the resolutions and stuff.  I will try to get more content up here this year.  So far I've kept this blog running.  I haven't abandoned it yet.  I have a ton more ideas that I just haven't written down yet.
