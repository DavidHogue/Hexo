Just wanted to post links to a couple local maps





  1. [CWOP Site Information for CW4520 in Bend, OR US](http://weather.gladstonefamily.net/site/C4520?tile=10;sx=3;sy=3#themap): Uses the Google Maps api and adds a Topo map and a USGS aerial map


  2. [The City of Bend's mapping page](http://maps.ci.bend.or.us/): Has a very detailed aerial map.  I was able to find my house and clearly see my car in the driveway.  (disclaimer: IE6 & ActiveX only)



I think I found the second from a local blog some time ago, but can't remember which one.

_Messed up the second link.  Fixed 12/10_
