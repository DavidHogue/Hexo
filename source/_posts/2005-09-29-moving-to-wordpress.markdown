I'm jumping around all the major blog engines.  I wonder how long this one will last...

I've already moved from Blosxom to Pyblosxom and now this.  I liked the idea of Blosxom with the text files as posts and how light it tried to be.  It just didn't seem to be easy enough to work with or have enough features for me.

WordPress seems a little overbearing and may be too much for me.  Firefox seems to act a little weird with some of the textboxes.  The font and buttons seems a little "big".

Movabletype is another one I was meaning to try, but I couldn't type `aptitude install movabletype`  :)
