Continuing my [viewstate tests](http://blog.vorpal.cc/category/development/does-viewstate-affect-search-ranking.html) to if it has any affect on search rankings.  My test pages for viewstate aren't showing up in Google yet.  The index page is there and [Palehorse's page](http://palehorse.wordpress.com/2007/05/30/viewstate-effects-on-search-engines/) is there.  I don't care if the test pages beat any other pages on the net, I just want to compare them relative to each other.

I figure I'd try linking to each page directly from here.  Also, I removed the test word from the index page and added links to all six test pages on each test page.  Here's the links: _Edit: removed since I'm long done with the test and tired of seeing file not found errors. :P_
