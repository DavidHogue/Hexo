I recently got to wondering who, if anyone, out there is reading my blog.  I've just been thinking about it and was getting curious.

I know at least one colleague at work that does.  I think there's a few developers in the .net community that are subscribed by now.  Anyone else from Bend?  Any of my friends in Eugene?

Anyway, if you feel like it and have the time, could you leave a short comment?
