There is a good article called ["Coding to Interfaces"](http://codebetter.com/blogs/eric.wise/archive/2005/12/15/135686.aspx) at CodeBetter.com.  It looks kinda long, but it's not a difficult a read.

There are many, many times where I have seen exactly what the author describes with overly complex inheritance and/or conditional logic.
