A new version of [Daemon Tools](http://www.daemon-tools.cc/) is out.  This is a handy utility that creates a virtual cd drive in Windows.  Though it's main audience seems to be gamers I find it incredibly useful for testing cd images.

I will often download an image and use it with this.  Sometimes I will rip a cd to an image for later use.  (Comes in handy when need the same CDs as someone else.)

There are a couple of things I don't really like about the new version:




  1. It interferes with kernel level debuggers.  Not that I use any, but I'm worried it might make my system unstable.


  2. It includes a "search toolbar".  Granted they do give you the option to not install it and they say they need the money.  Still it makes me a little reluctant to suggest the program to others.
