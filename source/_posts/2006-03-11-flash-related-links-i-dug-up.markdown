  * [Some guy on metafilter](http://ask.metafilter.com/mefi/8568) - He doesn't like the built in editor much (neither do I)[
](http://ask.metafilter.com/mefi/8568)

	
  * [Open Source Flash](http://www.osflash.org/) - osflash, found via a [Slashdot post](http://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=175030&cid=14553523&pid=14553523&threshold=-1&mode=nested&commentsort=0&op=Change)

	
  * [Adobe Labs](http://labs.macromedia.com/downloads/) - Not entirely flash, but there are some interesting betas and alphas here.  They also have a public wiki.  Very cool.

	
  * [kirupa.com](http://www.kirupa.com/developer/index.htm) - Found this while looking for something else, but it looks interesting.  They have some decent tutorials.

	
  * [ Publishing to Flash 8 with Swfmill and MTASC](http://www.flashant.org/index.php?p=429&more=1&c=1) - Create flash applications with content and code using a couple open source tools.

	
  * [Alcon](http://fgpwiki.corewatch.net/wiki/Alcon) - ActionScript logging console


When I started trying to learn Flash development (ActionScript in particular) I went and got the 30 day demo.  I learned a bit, but being a coder and not a designer I found it a little difficult to work with.  I'm sure it's great if you just want to draw some vector art, place it in key frames, play with tweening, etc.

I really didn't like the built in text editor and I already have a [text editor of choice](http://www.vim.org/).  So, the open source tools have two uses: 1) better text editor, 2) free!  The only thing I lose that Flash has is debugging with break points, but that's ok.

On a side note: When the hell did March get here?
