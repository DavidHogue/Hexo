The guys over at [Penny Arcade](http://penny-arcade.com) have had this charity going for the last few years.  Basically they give toys and video games to several childrens hospitals around the country.  It's really a good cause and shows that gamers aren't the evil psychos that the media makes us out to be.

So, if you have some extra cash this holiday season you should go check it out at [ChildsPlayCharity.org](http://childsplaycharity.org).
