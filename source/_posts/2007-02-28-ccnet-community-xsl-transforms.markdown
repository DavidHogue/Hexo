I was looking for some info on using FxCop with CruiseControl.NET and ran across a [page with XSL Transforms contributed by the community.](http://confluence.public.thoughtworks.org/display/CCNETCOMM/XSL+Transforms)

I'm posting this as a reference for myself more than anything else.  If anybody else finds it useful: great!

I found it initially from a link on [lukemelia.com](http://www.lukemelia.com/devblog/archives/2006/01/05/cruisecontrolnet-and-fxcop/).
