So I'm finally getting a new blog going.  [My old blog](http://blog.vorpal.cc/) has been dead for almost 3 years now.  I always intended to move it over to this site, but I never got around to it.  There have been times I wanted to post something now and then, half the time for my own reference, but I kept waiting until I got the new blog going for some reason.

Like that blog, this will probably mostly be technical posts related to my work as a software developer.  However, I'm not limiting myself to just that and if I have something more personal or random to post, I will.  Short thoughts and friends-only stuff is going to stay on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/davidhogue) and [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/DavidNHogue) though.
