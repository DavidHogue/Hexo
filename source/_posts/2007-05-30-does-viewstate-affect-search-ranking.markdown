Some say it might, some say it shouldn't.  I just want to see if it has any measurable affect.  If Google follows [this link](http://vorpal.cc/~david/rankingtest1.html), I should find out in a week or so.

I've never put up a set of pages to test a search engine like this before.  I started with a word that Google returns no results for.  I have [an index page](http://vorpal.cc/~david/rankingtest1.html) that links to several pages that use this word; all are identical except for the viewstate.  I have a couple copies of each page in random order in case the order of the links makes a difference.  The only page on the Internet that links to the different pages is [that index page](http://vorpal.cc/~david/rankingtest1.html).
