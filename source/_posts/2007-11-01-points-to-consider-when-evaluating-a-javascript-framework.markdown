I found [How to choose a JavaScript framework » d’bug](http://blog.reindel.com/2007/10/30/how-to-choose-a-javascript-framework/) (via [Ajaxian](http://ajaxian.com/archives/choosing-a-javascript-framework)).  In it the author brings up several things to consider when evaluating a framework.

It's somewhat related to my earlier post on [looking for a comparison of JavaScript frameworks](http://blog.vorpal.cc/category/development/so-many-javascript-libraries.html), and his was posted just a day before mine.

It's not the comparison table I was looking for, but if I ever get around to making that table I'll certainly use some of the points mentioned in it.  I think most of the article could apply to any framework developer tool, not just JavaScript frameworks.
