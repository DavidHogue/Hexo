I kind of like the blogging process.  Some time ago I had started a wiki to try and map my thoughts.  The problem was that so many of those thoughts weren't worth saving.  I just needed to write and maybe get some feedback.

So, I think I'm going to save the wiki for items that I want to be interconnected and ideas I want to hold on to.  Plus I love WordPress's 'Save as Draft'.  It lets me just get some stuff written without having to worry about presentation, spelling, etc.  Then at some point when I don't have anything useful to write I can publish it.

_This post, for example, was originally written over a month ago._
