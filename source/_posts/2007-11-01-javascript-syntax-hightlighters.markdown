I found some really cool code editors and syntax hightlighters written in JavaScript and I thought I'd share.

The best I've found so far is [CodePress](http://codepress.org/index.php).  It supports many languages, hightlights as you type, adds line numbers, and seems the most reliable.

[CodeMirror](http://marijn.haverbeke.nl/codemirror/index.html) is another one I found.  While it isn't as polished as CodePress, he [describes how he went about creating it](http://marijn.haverbeke.nl/codemirror/story.html) which I found helpful and interesting (especially the bit about the maniacal gnome.)

[EditArea](http://cdolivet.net/editarea/editarea/exemples/exemple_full.html) is another impressive one, but I haven't looked into it too much.

[CodeArea 2](http://los.php5.cz/codearea/codearea.html) has an example editing html, but I can't read any of the text around it since it is not written in English.  It's a .cz domain, the Czech Republic, where the speak Czech apparently.

Also, while looking for editors, I stumbled across [a vi clone in JavaScript](http://gpl.internetconnection.net/vi/).  It is impressively complete.  It's almost as cool as [DHTML Lemmings](http://www.elizium.nu/scripts/lemmings/).
