I'm finally breaking down and learning Flash / ActionScript.  I bought a couple of books and I'm looking for more good resources.  If you have any leave a comment.

For a while I have been confused about which version of [Flash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macromedia_Flash) is newest, how [Shockwave](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macromedia_Shockwave) is related.  Thanks to Wikipedia I now know. I have demos for Flash Studio Pro and FlashMX2004.  I don't know which is better.

Other questions: Is there a Flash Studio 8 or something?  Can I put ActionScript source in Subversion?  Can I write unit tests for ActionScript?

I just wish I knew more.  The Macromedia site just seems like it is all marketing and buzzwords, but no real useful content.
