So, a while ago [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) came out.  It's basically Google's web stats system.  It looks like it has a lot of cool options, pretty graphs, and a map that shows visitor's locations.

Google released this a while ago, so this may be old news by now.  I signed up soon after Google Analytics was announced, and just got a code today.  My stats probably won't be too interesting with the meager amount of traffic that I get, but we'll see.

On a side note: It's almost scary how much marketers can track us on the web.  I usually ignore the people that whine about Google and privacy issues and all.  Then again I figure I am less trackable than most people on the net.  (connect from multiple locations, wipe my cookies on browser close, adblock, no spyware, etc.)
