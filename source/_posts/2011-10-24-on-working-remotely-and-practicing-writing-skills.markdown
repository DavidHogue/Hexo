I've been doing a decent amount of work outside the office recently (or telecommuting as they used to call it.) This has been working pretty well, but I've been trying to improve my communication skills since that's been a little more difficult.

That's a good chunk of the reason I started my original blog: to get practice writing. I figured I'd never get better without practice, and practicing in public certainly makes me more careful about what I write and how sloppy I let my writing get.

I've been writing emails more since I'm not getting as much face-to-face communication. I've noticed it's almost more about what I don't write than what I do write. I've written giant wall of text emails before, and I think that caused people to just skim it. It takes a lot of work to write a good email that will get your ideas across and get people to respond with what you want.
