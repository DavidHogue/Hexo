I'm just clearing out my tabs in Firefox and have a few Flash related links that I thought I'd post for future reference.




	
  * [Showing DHTML content on top of flash content](http://www.bigroom.co.uk/blog/showing-dhtml-content-on-top-of-flash-content/) (with wmode).

	
  * [A stupid Flash bug](http://www.adobe.com/go/kb400730) that prevents JavaScript from talking to ActionScript through [ExternalInterface](http://www.adobe.com/go/kb400730)I would link to [Adobe's documentation for ExternalInterface](http://livedocs.adobe.com/flash/8/main/00002200.html), but it's worthless to me in Firefox.  I get nothing except a big dumb logo and a copyright notice.  You'd think a company as large as and as web based as Adobe or Macromedia could get their JavaScript working in more than one browser... in InternetExplorer when the Flash object is contained in a <form> tag.

	
  * [The awesome SWFObject](http://blog.deconcept.com/swfobject/) that makes cross browser standards compliant Flash detection and loading much easier.

	
  * [Some [workarounds](http://teratechnologies.net/stevekamerman/index.php?category=8) for the above mentioned Flash bug with the above mentioned SWFObject.



There, now I can close those tabs that have been open for days.
