So, I've slowly been cramming as much Flash info into my head as I can get in there.  I have a couple cheesy files from trying to learn ActionScript.   I found that I can edit Action Script with notepad, there are several unit testing frameworks.  Once I got to a certain point in scripting I had to go back and learn the interface so that I could create buttons, movie clips, and such.

Two of the better books I have are Essential ActionScript 2.0 and Flash Hacks.  Essential ActionScript 2.0 is definitely the book I was looking for.  Flash Hacks is interesting and should bring me up to speed with some various elements of Flash.
