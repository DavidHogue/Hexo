Finally resolved an issue that was keeping my blog offline for several days. Apparently the Wordpress update was not compatible with a plugin I had.

Unfortunately it took hours to discover that because php would give me no errors when it loaded. I'd get a http 500 and a blank page. No errors logs or anything. I should really setup a monitoring service so I find these things quicker in the future.
