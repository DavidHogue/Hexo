Good news from [KTVZ](http://www.ktvz.com/story.cfm?storyID=16134): "Eight-mile-long burn 'greatly reduces' threat".  Red Cross has a shelter at at [Sky View Middle School](http://www.google.com/maps?f=l&hl=en&q=skyview+middle+school&near=Bend,+OR+97701&ie=UTF8&om=1&ll=44.092763,-121.293612&spn=0.043706,0.090809), which is literally a stones throw from my house.

I can hear a low flying plane overhead as I type this.

Here's a list of local media and blogs that mention the fire:

I've heard at least 3 planes now, maybe more.  And a siren...

I've been hearing a lot of talk of the Awbrey Hall fire in 1990.  I wasn't around for that.  We moved here in '92 (I think, memory's a bit hazy).
