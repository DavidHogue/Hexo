A coworker of mine (who sits right next to me and has twice as many monitors as I do) is blogging again.  His blog, titled Pale Musings, is at [palehorse.wordpress.com](http://palehorse.wordpress.com/).

Recently he has posted some good info and links for speeding up TortoiseSVN, the Sql Server 2005 tools, and Visual Studio.  Anyway, I'm looking forward to some more techie/geeky/.netty posts.The Firefox dictionary doesn't like techie, but it suggests Trekkie.  Interesting.  And it's yet another local blog; there's a surprising number of other local blogs over at [bendblogs.com](http://bendblogs.com/)

I know I haven't been posting much lately, but I'm hoping that will change soon.  Holidays, and work, and friends, and family, and other interests just take up so much time and energy.  I really haven't felt like writing much.  I do have some ideas to write about now, so one of these days I'll sit down and see what I can come up with.
