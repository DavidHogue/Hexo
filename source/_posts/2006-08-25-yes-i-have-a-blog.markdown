So, the word has gotten out to a few people I know that I have a blog.  This was mostly due to my post about [TortoiseSVN in Visual Studio](http://vorpal.cc/blog/development/tortoisesvn-in-visual-studio).

The first to link that post was [Ayende](http://www.ayende.com/).  I try to read his blog regularly, there's some good stuff on there.  He also wrote [Rhino Mocks](http://www.ayende.com/projects/rhino-mocks.aspx) which is now my mock framework of choice.

From there it spread to [Larkware](http://larkware.com/) and [DotNetKicks.com](http://www.dotnetkicks.com/).  The majority of the traffic coming from Larkware.

All this lead back to Joel who sits next to me.  One morning he turned to me and asked if the vorpal.cc domain was mine and sure enough it was. He's got a [blog](http://blogs.smartz.com/) too, but it hasn't been updated in ages...

I don't really talk about this place much in my day to day conversations.  In fact I hardly promote it at all.  I submitted it to a couple of blog sites and search engines, but that's about it.  I figure if the content is here the search engines will eventually pick it up and people will follow the search engines.

This blog, like most, is almost more for me than it is for you.  What I mean is that I don't necessarily write my content for a targeted audience.  I don't post regularly.  What I do write about are things that interest me.  I write when I feel like it.  I write when I have something I want to tell somebody about, but don't necessarily want to bore my family with it.

I'm kind of surprised nobody I know saw the [black crater fire pictures](http://vorpal.cc/blog/bend/pictures-of-the-black-crater-fire) post.  I got a fair number of hits on that from a few local blogs (mostly [Utterly Boring](http://www.utterlyboring.com/)).

I don't really think of having a blog as a big deal.  I mean there's 100 million myspace accounts out there meaning about 1 in 3 Americans has an account.  I figured just about everybody had at least one blog by now.  It could be that I'm just off in my own little techie world though.

One last thing:  The site is mostly MySQL / PHP / Linux based.  I'm perfectly ok with writing about .NET on a non-.NET platform.  At some point I would like to write a mono-based application for my blog to run on, but I just don't have the time.  For now I'm perfectly content with using and tweaking existing open source products.
