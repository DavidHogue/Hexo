I'm updating the design of this place so it doesn't have the stock Wordpress theme going on anymore. It was a decent enough look, but I wanted something that was mine.

I'm no designer and I know I could find someone more talented to do this kind of thing, but this isn't exactly a commercial site. I'll probably keep tweaking the look a bit to make it a little better, but I want to stick with something that looks kind of like this.

Someday soon, I'm going to try to move my old content over to this blog.

Then I'll have to actually spend time writing some content instead of distracting myself with technical things to tweak.

Oh, and the redesign looks decent on a mobile browser. Or at least it's pretty usable.
