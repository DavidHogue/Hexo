It seems like I don't have any time these days. I'm getting a lot done, but is it the stuff I want to be spending my time on? And could I be more efficient about getting through it?

Between work eating up as much time as I will let it, spending time with my girl, being somewhat social, upgrading people's PCs, trying to get through a game, and trying to read more (currently in the middle of re-reading the Hobbit!) I have no free time. Oh yeah, I should also mention that trying to write a blog will eat up a bunch of time too. :)

Yeah, I want to do a lot. Probably more than I am realistically able to. However, with some work I am able to keep a surprising number of things going. Not everything I'd ever like to do, but more than I would have thought.

Some things that have helped:





  
  * Task lists, calendars and notebooks. This probably deserves it's own post. I'm using a bit of GTD (aka Getting Things Done) with Outlook, Google Calendar and Evernote. There are entire blogs dedicated to this that might be a better resource.


  
  * Exercise and sleep. Yes they both take time, but you're able to better spend the rest of the time if you stay on top of them. I'm honestly still working on this. It's not easy!


  
  * Getting up a bit earlier. I'm usually in bed pretty early these days, which means I sometimes get up earlier than I used to. I was never a morning person, but I do see the appeal. I'm writing this in the morning before I have to work.

  
  * I'm spending less time on the things that don't interest me as much. I spend far less time on Facebook now. Less time with the Xbox even than I used to. I would like to spend some free time coding again.


  
  * If I still don't have time to do something at some point I have to decide what to drop. I can always take it up later if I want, but it's still not usually an easy decision.


So that's how I'm getting by until I can make a 30 hour day or invent time travel.


So what do you think? Was this useful? Do you have any tips to add?
