Just looking around for some JavaScript libraries to use in some new code, I came up with all these libraries:




	
  1. [Prototype](http://www.prototypejs.org/)

	
  2. [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)

	
  3. [MochiKit](http://mochikit.com/index.html)

	
  4. [MooTools](http://mootools.net/)

	
  5. [script.aculo.us](http://script.aculo.us/)

	
  6. [Dojo](http://dojotoolkit.org/)

	
  7. [Ext JS](http://extjs.com/)

	
  8. [ASP.NET AJAX Control Toolkit](http://www.asp.net/ajax/ajaxcontroltoolkit/)

	
  9. [The Yahoo! User Interface Library (YUI)](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/)

	
  10. [SimpleJS](http://simplejs.bleebot.com/)



I haven't been able to find a decent comparison of the different frameworks (what they do, compatibility, download size).  I might come up with my own table soon if I can't find anything.

I have used the ASP.NET AJAX Control ToolkitASP.NET AJAX Control Toolkit with ASP.NET AJAX are two different things btw.  I've just been calling the whole thing msajax just because the naming is so ambigous, YUI, and Prototype so far.  I think those three are compatible, but I'm not sure.  (What I should say is nothing has broken from using the three libraries in a single app.)

Does anyone out there have any good comparisons between all the major libraries?
