A while ago I was looking for an application that would run on my phone that I could could use to connect to this blog.  I wasn't planning on using it much, but I thought it'd be useful for jotting down notes for later.  I thought there ought to be a few that could connect to a blogging api.  I even found a few that claimed to, but I never got them to work.

You know what I found?  My phone's web browser. I finally realized that I could just connect with the browser and have all the same features available as if I were at my desk.  I don't know why it took me so long to realize that, but it did.

And then, just today: I wanted to check the temperature before going out.  "There must be a ton of weather apps out there" I thought.  I started searching for one.  And then I realized something.  I could just type [97701 temp](http://www.google.com/xhtml/search?client=ms-ericsson-rcc-us&oe=ISO-8859-1&ie=ISO-8859-1&mrestrict=xhtml&q=97701+temperature+) into Google and it would give me exacty what I wanted.

Anyway, I've just come to realize how I can do most anything online with nothing more than a web browser.  Nothing revolutionary, just an observation.

By the way I wrote and posted this entire post from my phone's browser, just because I can.
