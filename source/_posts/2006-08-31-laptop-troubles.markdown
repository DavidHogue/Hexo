Several months ago I dropped my laptop and it landed on the power cable.  This damaged the little round plug where the power cable plugs in.  At first this didn't cause me any problems.

However a few weeks later it would spontaneously turn off.  No shutdown, no saving, just off.  After a while I noticed it only happened if I pushed the cable one way or another.  So I tried to keep the cable still, but it just got worse.

Eventually I opened the thing up and watched what was happening as I plugged in the cable.  It was shorting out on my processor's heatsink!  Not good.  So, I Macgyvered it with a paperclip and plastic bottle cap.  That got me going for a while.

Things got worse again: the AC adapter was coming loose and not making a connection.  So I went and found a replacement AC adapter and proceeded to replace the bad one.  I had to remove _everything_ from the laptop to get at it, then unsolder the old adapter and soldering a new one on.

I took [pictures of the whole process](https://vorpal.cc/gallery2/v/Other/laptop/) in case anyone is interested.

The replacement didn't go as smoothly as I would have liked.  First it didn't turn on at all, found out I was shorting it out.  Then the power adapter wasn't recognized as a Dell adapter.  This meant I couldn't charge my battery and my processor was stuck at 600MHz.

For a few weeks I lived with the unrecognized adapter.  But then something came loose and I had no power unless I positioned the plug in just the right way.

Today I finally cracked it open to have another look.  I poked and proded at the AC adapter to try to get a better connection.  I resoldered some points.  The first time I went to turn it on I forgot to put the RAM back in and it wouldn't start.  The second time the LCD cable was loose and it put random dots and lines on the screen.

The third time it worked.  My power adapter is even recognized.  Finally I have everything back together and working.  I can charge my battery, I can go over 600MHz, and I can type this from bed.

Hopefully it's fixed for good now.
