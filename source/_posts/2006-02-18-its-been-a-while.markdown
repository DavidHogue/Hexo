Wow, It's been over 3 weeks since my last post.

I have been so busy at work lately that I don't even know what I've been doing this whole time.  Other than work I've had some issues with the DMV and the court system.  I've got some issues at home (not saying anymore.  I'd rather keep personal stuff out of here.)  I've also had a birthday since then.

Last weekend I added some color to this site.  Previously this has been a little sparse and simplistic.  Partially because i just wanted it that way.  The colors were mostly lifted from the [css Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/?cssfile=187/187.css).  I still want to add a few images to the theme, but I don't know when I'll have time to do so.

Another reason I haven't been posting is that writing is difficult for me.  In school I was always better at math and sience than english.  Since then I have realized how much I suck at writing and I want to get better at it.  That's part of why I am writing here in the first place, but I don't want it to become a chore.  I feel that if I push too hard I won't want to continue with writing after a while.
