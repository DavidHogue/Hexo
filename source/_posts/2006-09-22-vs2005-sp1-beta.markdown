[Visual Studio 2005 SP1](https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/content/content.aspx?ContentID=3311) is getting closer.  The beta is due on the 25th.

It looks you have to apply "by filing out the nomination survey" to get the beta.

I can't wait for this to come out.  vs2005 has so many issues that need fixing.
