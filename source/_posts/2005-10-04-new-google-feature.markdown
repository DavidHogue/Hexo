I just noticed something new in my Google searches: there is a remove result link.  I've often wanted the ability to hide certain sites.  Often these are junk sites with no real content, or content that is taken straight from another (usually easier to use) site.

I found some more info [over here](http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/remove-result/).
