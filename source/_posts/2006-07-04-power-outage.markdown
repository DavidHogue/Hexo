Just as we were about to leave work for the day the power went out.  Most of our servers and desktops have UPSs (which immediately started beeping in unison).  All the lights were out, but the monitors were still providing enough light to get around with.

The power must have been out for 45 minutes or so.  Our batteries only last 20 or 30 minutes, so after a while we were trying to shut servers down before their batteries died.  My site as well as a few services we provide were offline most of the time.  Our more heavily used servers are co-located and they have bigger batteries and generators should the power go out there.

Everything seems to be back up now.  I'm guessing the power was out due to the thunderstorms in the area.  I heard some good ones before the outage and have been hearing thunder since the power came back.

Anyway, it made for a bit of excitement before the holiday.
