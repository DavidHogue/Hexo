Found this in my inbox earlier today:



> Good morning,

Here are some fresh aerial shots of  the Black Crater fire taken early
this morning. The fire is up to about 2600 acres now. I saw flames
erupting and jumping approx 40-50 ft high at 6:30 AM. That is with
things cool and calm!
There is a lot of dry fuel up there. This afternoon will be a real
critical time when the winds and heat pick up again. The winds have been
out of the west and are pushing the fire predominantly east. Crossroads
is still the real danger spot as far as larger housing developments go.
Tollgate, BBR, Aspen Lakes are safe at this point. My plane was dusted
in ashes this morning but so far they have been cooled off by the time
they drop around Sisters.

Please remember our firefighters in your prayers today. They have a
rough road in front of them.

Your eye in the sky,
Bruce
