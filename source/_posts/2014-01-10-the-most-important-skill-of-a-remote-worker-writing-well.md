It's easy to say communication is important, but I never see resources for learning how to. I see examples saying you can email or instant message or call, but not much on how to turn an email into actions.

The biggest part for me is being able to write well. Good writing can keep everyone in the loop. Good writing can motivate others to get some work done for you. Without that you're on your own and likely heading in a different direction from everyone else.

But even the best writing can't help if no one reads it or if you're dealing with a stubborn asshole. Phone calls and in person meetings can help, but they're less frequent and harder to organize.

When I say writing I mostly mean emails. They can be just long enough to contain a complete message. Every word needs to count and you need to decide what you want the person on the other end to do after reading it.

Try to take some techniques from good writers. Start with a hook to get them interested.

Or start with a question or request and then explain it afterwards? I know I used to wait until the last line to make my request and I'd get ignored a lot.

I recently read "On Writing Well" and the classic "The Elements of Style". I'd really recommend both and I feel like I'll be re-reading them next year.
