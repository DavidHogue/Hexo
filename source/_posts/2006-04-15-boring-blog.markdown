I realize that most of the stuff I write about here is probably very boring to most people.  I am writing more for myself than anyone else.  I just need to put my thoughts down simetimes.  Hopefully by making this stuff public I can help someone else out there.

I'm trying not to assume that everyone reading this knows what I'm talking about.  Sometimes it can be easy for me to assume the reader is familiar with certain ideas or programs, but I know most probably aren't.  I'm really just trying to get better at writing and doing it in public like this can be tough.
