For a while now I have been annoyed with WordPress's admin area.  I like most of it, but it insists on making all the links http://foo even if I typed in https://foo.

I finally found a way around this using mod_proxy.  [This page was a major help in getting that working.](http://blog.blackdown.de/2005/05/18/securing-wordpress-admin-access-with-ssl/)

Though I think I may have broken the spell-checker plugin...
