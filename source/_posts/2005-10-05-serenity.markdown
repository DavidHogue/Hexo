I went and saw Serenity tonight.  I went to my parents at 7:00 thinking I might take my brother to the 7:20 showing if he wasn't busy.  Mom and Dad decided to go too, so they took dinner out of the oven and we all ran to the theater.  This was very unusual for them as usually we plan out a movie days in advance, leave for the theater an hour and a half before showtime, etc.

Now about the movie: I liked it.  Characters and background story were introduced very quickly and in a series of series of flashback within flashback .  Dialog was good, but there wasn't as much as I would have liked.  The action to character/plot development ratio was higher than the series.  It felt a bit rushed and "action packed", but overall well put together.

It was nice to see the all the characters I missed from the series again.  I love Kaylee, Jayne is just funny (The mudders episode is one of my favorites).  I would have liked to learn more about Shepherd's past, but oh well.  Several story threads were brought to their conclusion so it might not be best to start with the movie and then move on to the series.
