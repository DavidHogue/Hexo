I used to think I knew a lot about how to computer networks worked and how to setup a mid-size network.  I knew how to assign IPs, how to setup a DHCP server, setup other servers.  I knew how to setup NAT with a small Linux box.  My computers were relatively secure (or so I thought).

For some reason a few months ago I became really interested in networking.  Specifically the security side of computer networks.  I had used nmap before and heard of snort, but I had no idea how little I knew.

I'm just going to list a few of the utilities I have found recently that helped to open my eyes:




  * [Cain & Able](http://www.oxid.it/cain.html): A windows program that can crack passwords, sniff traffic, show the contents of password boxes, etc.


  * [ettercap](http://ettercap.sourceforge.net/): Tool for doing man in the middle attacks.  It can do arp spoofing which allows (among other things) sniffing on a switched network.


  * [Auditor](http://remote-exploit.org/index.php/Auditor_main) and [Whax](http://www.iwhax.net/modules/news/): 2 Linux based live cds with enough network and security tools to keep anyone busy for a while.



There are more, but that is what comes to mind right now.  Hopefully in the future I will be able to write more on this topic.  I don't know why I haven't 'till now.  It's a fascinating subject.
