So, in a [post](http://vorpal.cc/wp/?p=3) yesterday I mentioned that I wanted to try NHibernate.  Today I went looking for information about it.  I type it into [Feedster](http://feedster.com/search.php?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&q=nhibernate&sort=date) to see if there were any blogs about it.

I'm the second link there!  That's just cool.  I didn't setup anything to do that other than WordPress (and I any barely changed any of the default settings).  With how interconnected blogs are it's no wonder that they get the google rankings they do.

I had originally dismissed blogging because most of the technology is basic or a new take on old ideas.  RSS: just a different way to view the same data; Posting and comments have been done before.  And I never thought much about pings and trackbacks before.  They always just weird comments that I would see sometimes.  And of course the word itself seemed a little silly.
