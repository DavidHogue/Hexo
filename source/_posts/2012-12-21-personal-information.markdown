I've been thinking to myself for a while now about adding more personal posts here. I've stayed away so far because I figure anyone that does happen to subscribe to my rss feed probably isn't all that interested. Facebook has been where I have most of my online social interactions, but I've been wanting to tone that down some.

With the tragedies last week maybe it's time to write something here. Some of them hit really close to home, I had friends over at Clackamas Town Center that day. I've also had some sad things happen in the family. My grandmother passed away and many of my childhood memories of her were from Christmas so this year has been kind of rough. And not long before that my parent's had the dog put down.

I guess maybe what I'm trying to say is that our personal lives do affect our professional lives. Maybe keeping them separate isn't what I should be doing. What I should be doing is writing more, because if nothing else I could really use the practice. And really, this information isn't that private.

I've been doing some reading, most notably of [Anil Dash's The Web We Lost](http://dashes.com/anil/2012/12/the-web-we-lost.html) and I want to put more of my content on my own domain and then share it or copy it over to Facebook & Twitter (and I guess Google+ too.)

Oh, and we're moving to a new house. What better time to start making some changes than with a complete change of environment? Maybe I'm just rambling here, but maybe that's not a bad thing.
