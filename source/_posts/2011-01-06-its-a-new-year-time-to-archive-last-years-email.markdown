The last few years I've taken to backing up all of the previous year's email and deleting most of it.  This keeps my exchange account from taking up too much space, Outlook from bogging down, and I can still find those old emails if I really do need them someday.

My basic process has been to create a new .pst file, then copy my top level folders one by one via drag and drop with shift held down.  Then I'll make a search folder in the .pst for anything older than last year, 2010 in this case, and delete it all.  After all that I can detach the .pst, zip it, and store it on a separate drive.

After everything is backed up I'll use a few search folders in my Exchange account to delete any huge emails and really old emails.  I tend to do a little more cleanup at this time too like deleting folders for really old projects.

I never needed to do this in the beginning, but these days I'm getting more email and it builds up eventually.  I'll delete a lot of it and I try to keep my inbox empty, but there are certain times it's been useful to dig out that odd old email I thought I wouldn't ever need again.

There's likely a simpler way to do all this with auto-archiving or something, but this has been working well for me and it keeps everything nice and organized just the way I want it.
