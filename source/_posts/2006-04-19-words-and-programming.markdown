I think a good word for an idea makes it much easier to grasp and use.  For example: provider pattern.  It obviously _provides_ something

Some other words:



    
  * **Adapter**: Class that wraps existing code in an interface needed by another piece of the program.

    
  * **Stub**: Very basic implementation used as a placeholder.  Useful while developing code that needs a service, but you don't want to use the whole service because it is too slow or doesn't exist yet.

    
  * **Velocity**: [If the build breaks, it hinders the velocity of the other developers..."](http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeffrey.palermo/archive/2006/01/17/136625.aspx)

    
  * **Utility**: a utility function is a function that takes an input and returns a value without external dependencies.



I want to get better at writing partially to get better at coding.  I think a good chunk of coding is good naming and clear code.  I have read somewhere that you should write code a human can understand, not a computer.  If you just write something the computer can understand we'd all still be writing assembler, or worse machine code.

Many of my examples were [design patterns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_pattern_(computer_science)).  The purpose of defining a design pattern is so that developers can have a common vocabulary.  So, that when someone says they are going to make an adapter class, everyone knows what they mean.  I think they fit this post rather well.
