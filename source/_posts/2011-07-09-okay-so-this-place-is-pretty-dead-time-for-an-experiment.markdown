When I started up this new blog, I figured it'd be slow but I would post every once in a while.  That hasn't really happened, it's been six months since I last posted.  That's partly due to being too busy, partly due to being to tired, and partly because I didn't know what to write about.

I still don't know exactly what this place is going to be.  I figured I could post coding tutorials and thoughts since Facebook pretty much covers personal stuff.  But then every time I got an idea for something to write, I'd throw it out because it wouldn't meet that narrow focus.

I'm going to try posting once a week and see how it goes.  I do have a bunch of thoughts to get down on paper and I think making my online presence larger would be good for me.

I'm not counting this as my post for the week either, right now I have two posts about this blog and only one post about anything useful.  What will it be?  Who knows.  Maybe about coding, or home servers, or D&D;, or even a recipe.
