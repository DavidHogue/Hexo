Good news everyone: I wasn't wasting my time like [I thought I was](https://vorpal.cc/blog/posts/ever-feel-like-your-wasting-your-time).  Today the client for the very project I was talking about was asking about adding to the project and changing some things.

They said they wanted to do things right and even stop to fix things up for a month if it was necessary.  Luckily they don't need to stop and work can continue thanks to the extra time I spent cleaning up the system.  They also stressed that they want the system to be flexible to new requests and challenges as it grows to fill more needs in their business.

And just today I managed to fix some design issues that have been bugging me for a while.  I also was able to fix many unit tests thanks to the changes.  Tests had been written and abandoned long ago, more about that in a later post.  I'm also planning a post about how I broke apart huge unweildy class that had too many responsibilities.

P.S.  Anyone else use Google as a spell checker?
