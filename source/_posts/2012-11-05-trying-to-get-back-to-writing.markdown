So my blog has been pretty dead lately. It's been over 3 months since my last post. I want to do something about that and I could make a bunch of excuses: I've been too busy, I don't know what to write, etc., etc.

I'm going to try an experiment. I've been trying to use the [Pomodoro technique](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/) at work when I get stuck. If you haven't heard of it, all you do is set a timer for 25 minutes and try to focus without getting distracted. Then take a 5 minute break to get all your distractions out of the way. And repeat. I like using [Focus Booster](http://www.focusboosterapp.com/) for my timer.

Anyway, what I want to do is spend at least one 25 minute block a week writing something here. It might be the most insightful or in depth writing ever, but at least I'll get some momentum going. That's the important thing I think: is starting and then keeping at it until it becomes habit.

Also as part of this experiment, I may start writing about some new topics. So far this blog has been almost entirely about my work and the tools and languages I use there. If I start branching out, I'm hoping I'll have more to say. And I may put up a few posts completely unrelated to programming or computers altogether. We'll see.

If I get really off topic, I could start posting some recipes that I find tasty or some pictures from Comicon. For a while I avoided stuff like that because I thought it might take away from the programming/work related posts. In the past I kept that kind of stuff on Facebook or Twitter, but I think my own site is a better long term home for some of it.

And no, I'm not participating in NaNoWriMo, but I would like to write more. I could always use some improvement to my communication skills. That's really the original reason I started blogging way back when.
