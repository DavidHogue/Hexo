So Internet Explorer 7 has been out for over a year (it was released on October 18th), yet there are still enough IE6 users that we still have to code for it.  IE6 has some horrible rendering inconsistencies and bugs that have to be worked around and unfortunately it was out for so long and had so much market share that it's just not going away.  IE7 was a little better, but not great.  

I'm hopeful for IE8, but who knows.  IE 8, if you haven't heard has a third rendering mode, in addition to standard and quirks modes, that is triggered by a meta tag (see [this A List Apart page for some details](http://alistapart.com/articles/beyonddoctype).)  I'm not terribly fond of the new meta tag, but I can live with it I guess.

A few months ago my blog's stats were showing a 50/50 split between IE6 and IE7.  Now it's closer to 75% IE7 and 25% IE6.  The [browser stats page at W3Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp) has IE6 ahead of IE7 with 33.2% 21.0% of the total market.

Anyway, a few days ago I saw [a story on Slashdot](http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/01/21/0652248) saying Microsoft is going to IE7 updates.  I assume this just means they will make it a high priority update.  Hopefully this will make the IE6 market share small enough that we can finally ignore it.
