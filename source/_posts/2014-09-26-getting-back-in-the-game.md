Alright, it's about time I got back into this. I've been getting tired of working on development projects lately. I thought I was just tired or too busy, but honestly I was burned out. I need something new and actually challenging to work on.

I've been learning a lot in areas other than development lately. My photography is much better this year and I still want to put more time into that. Partially because of that I have a kick-ass backup system on a home server with ZFS and 8TB of raw storage, all encrypted btw. My Linux server is faster and more secure than ever. I have a decent portfolio up and I think my resume looks pretty awesome. I'm putting a lot of time into fitness and being healthy too, I'm on a good path there and actually trying to gain some weight for once.

But software development is what really drives me. I like learning about the internals of platforms and what makes them tick. I like having a lot of data to analyze and working on making an app significantly faster than it ever was. Lately all my stuff at work just doesn't push me that way anymore.

I'm going to start looking for ideas for new side-projects and maybe volunteering some more of my time. There's a non-profit that wants some help on their website, and I'd like to start hacking on the Magic Lantern firmware for my camera. I'm going to make myself actually attend more meetups that are relevant. And honestly I need to think more about my career and see if I can get in somewhere that lets me work on the hard problems (or at least make decent contributions to a major platform.)
