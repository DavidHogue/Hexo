Now that I have my [build server](http://vorpal.cc/blog/posts/build-server) running I have been thinking about builds and scheduling releases.  With most of the stuff I work on there isn't any kind of regular schedule.  I work on a project and write some code.  When I get that working how I want I send the compiled form to the client or update a server depending on the type of project.  (That's simplifying a bit, but you get the picture.)

Recently it seems like we could use a regular schedule for shipping builds.  One client we have is getting a build every week.  Another has been getting new versions every week or three depending on how much time I can put in and how much there is to do.

I know about about the XP/agile [iterations](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/map/iteration.html).  I'm not buying wholesale into XP or agile (I don't even know the difference between the two).  The idea of iterations kind of makes sense and I can see some advantages: The customer regularly gets updates and can see the work getting done.  A number of tasks are decided on at the beginning of each iteration where the customer can have some input and items are prioritized.

Anyone out there have any advice or thoughts on a build schedule?  Do you have a regular schedule or just release builds as they become ready for the client?  If you do have a regular schedule, what is it?  Twice a week? Every four weeks?
