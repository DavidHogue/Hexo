I've been playing with the [ScrewTurn Wiki](http://www.screwturn.eu/) for a while this weekend and I'm really starting to like it.  I'm looking into converting our [MoinMoin](http://moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de/) based wiki to it sometime soon.

ScrewTurn has been easy to set up and work with.  At first I thought the markup looked more limited, but when I went to the documentation it listed everything I thought was missing.  The whole experience has just been easy and well documented.  Unusual in an open source project.

The wiki itself feels quite a bit like MediaWiki to me.  MediaWiki is the software that powers Wikipedia.  Sections can be edited individually, there is a discussion tab for each page, images default to floating right.  The output is XHTML, layout is done with CSS.

Some history: I wanted to start up a company wiki a while back.  I started with FlexWiki because it was open source and looked like it might progress quickly.  It was at the time the best .net wiki I could find.  Unfortunately, it was too young a project: it had some weird quirks, and rendered badly in Firefox.  

When I went looking for non-.net wikis I decided on MoinMoin.  It seemed to have a lot of features, plugins, and was more mature than FlexWiki.  It never really quite fit in with our infrastructure.  MoinMoin is written in Python and was running on Apache in Windows.  It worked great for a while, but I haven't had time to maintain it and each new version seems to bring in more problems.

So now I'm going to try converting all the pages over to ScrewTurn and I guess I'll see how it goes.
