I just had a few links to stuff I've been reading recently that I thought I'd post.  More for my future reference than anything else.  Most of them are software development related and I would think they would be pretty boring for most people.





  * 
[ Implementing the Domain Model](http://codebetter.com/blogs/scott.bellware/archive/2006/01/09/136362.aspx) by Scott Bellware continuing a great series of posts about developing an application.



  * 
[Best and Worst Practices for Mock Objects](http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/archive/2006/01/10/136407.aspx) by Jeremy D. Miller continuing a series on mock objects.



  * 
[ MSF for Agile update released - still doesn't hit the mark](http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeffrey.palermo/archive/2006/01/11/136437.aspx) by Jeffrey Palermo.  Just yesterday I was skimming through a Microsoft book called "Analyzing Requirements and Defining Microsoft .NET Solution Architectures".  (This was for a certification test I was considering.  See [this](http://blogs.smartz.com/index.php/archives/109) and [this](http://blogs.smartz.com/index.php/archives/110))  The whole process seemed very rigid with lots of documentation.  Plus, there was one of the most ridiculous architectures I have ever heard of: the Layered-client-cache-stateless-cache-server architecture!



  * 
[Better Time Tracking](http://controlledagility.typepad.com/weblog/2005/11/better_time_tra.html) on Controlled Agility about time tracking, estimating, tasks, management.  I know we (as do most developers) struggle with these topics.  He's got some interesting ideas if nothing else.



  * 
[Code Templates in Visual Studio 2005](http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/06/01/CodeTemplates/default.aspx) on msdn.  Attemting to modify the templates in VS2003 was not at all easy to do.  I'm glad added some support for custom templates with the new version.



Also, unrelated to software development: If you haven't tried [Pandora](http://pandora.com/), go try it.  It is personalized streaming music.  You tell it a song or band and it just starts playing similar music right on the page.  No setup, no installation,  no giving them all your personal details, etc.   It's kind of like [last.fm](http://last.fm), but different.
