DHL said it arrived yesterday, but I never saw it.  Turns out DHL used USPS and it was in the mailbox.

Anyway, the book is [Applying Domain-Driven Design and Patterns: With Examples in C# and .NET](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321268202?ie=UTF8&tag=vorpalccblog-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0321268202)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=vorpalccblog-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0321268202).  I just finished the first chapter and although a lot of it was familiar to me, I liked the author's writing style and found it more engaging than some of the more abstract books on the patterns, architecture, and designI have [Domain-Driven Design](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321125215?ie=UTF8&tag=vorpalccblog-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0321125215)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=vorpalccblog-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0321125215), [Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321127420?ie=UTF8&tag=vorpalccblog-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0321127420)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=vorpalccblog-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0321127420), and [Design Patterns](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201633612?ie=UTF8&tag=vorpalccblog-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0201633612)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=vorpalccblog-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0201633612).  I really like the books and I have learned a _ton_ from them, it's just that they are a little dense and abstract.  I don't know that I feel comfortable giving them to someone new to the concepts..  He mentioned several tools that I use daily like [NUnit](http://www.nunit.org/index.php) and [CruiseControl.net](http://confluence.public.thoughtworks.org/display/CCNET/Welcome+to+CruiseControl.NET).

I'm hoping this book will be both a good introductory book that I can give to people and that it will give me with some practical examples of how to actually work with DDD in .net.  I really want to read through it as quick as I can so that can try to get some other people at work interested.

We have been using some things like unit tests and continuous integration and I think it has greatly improved our process and the quality of our code.  Hopefully concepts like domain models and the object-relational impedance mismatch can spur further improvements.
