I'm going to try this out again (blogging).  First some links: 







[Exposing a Connection String as a Public Property is a Huge Design Smell](http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/archive/2005/09/28/132571.aspx)  Makes a lot of sense.  It seems insecure to me.  Most every project I work on with a connection string used like this has had hundreds of connection.open()s and been very inconsistant.







[NHibernate](http://wiki.nhibernate.org/display/NH/Home) Someday I've got to try using this in a project.







[Uncle Bob on the visitor pattern](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.IuseVisitor)  This was a very informative page.  Especially the comments about why it is necessary ad how it is  a simple hack to get around language restrictions.
