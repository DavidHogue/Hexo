Check it out!  I made a simple mp3 player in flash.

_Bah, I'm having some trouble getting it to format nicely the post.  Go to the [html page](/~david/Mp3Player.html) to view it._

OK, so it's not much,  and it's not pretty.  It was more of a learning project than anything else.  I made a class for the player and all the buttons call functions in that class.  I started with [this](http://www.tutorialoutpost.com/count/3287).  I really didn't like their naming conventions, nor putting everything in the fla.

One thing I've noticed is that actionscript suffers from the same problems as javascript.  Namely non-developers copy and paste code and you can put the code just about anywhere.
