Continuing my [previous post](http://vorpal.cc/blog/category/development/starting-with-xna.html)...

The more I think about it, the more I think XNA is a good fit for what I want to do right now.




	
  1. I want to make small demos.  Something closer to Pac-Man than Quake 4

	
  2. I don't need or want the best graphics.  I could spend all my time tweaking shaders if I wanted, but I'd rather get a working game out there.

	
  3. I know C#.  It's probably the language I'm most familiar with right now.  My C++ skills are a bit rusty.  Plus, I think I can write some really high quality, high performance managed code.

	
  4. For $100 I can get it running on a console.  I do enjoy homebrew development, but you're not going to get a sizable audience that way.  I still love the pure simplicity of coding for a GameBoy Advance without messing APIs, libraries, garbage collection, etc.

	
  5. I might be able to get something on to XBox Live.  They've delivered on everything else so far, so it seems likely that at least a few XNA games will make it to Live.



Also, XNA was released earlier this week.  I'm not joining the Creators Club yet, 'cause I don't own an XBox yet, but I may join in the future.  I wonder if I could buy a controller and hook that up to a PC for testing though...

Besides, even if I start a game with XNA, I should be able to port it to other languages/systems later.  I'm really into this more for a learning experience or a hobby than trying to create a professional game.  I doubt I'll make any money off it, but I might make some decent demos.

What I need to get working on now is some placeholder graphics and sounds, some basic entity classes (player, model, level, etc).  Just get a very basic engine up and running.

Some other things to do: Figure out how to use NUnit with it (running tests in game on an XBox would be cool), see if IronPython runs on the version of the Compact Framework XNA uses.  I doubt Python will work, but it'd be awesome if it does.  I also need to get a few graphics, models, and sounds that can be used as placeholders.
