So I got Office 2007 today.  I've only used Outlook so far and it seems alright.  I like some of the new stuff.  The "To-Do Bar" is nice.

I find it a little odd that the main window isn't consistent with the rest of the applications: it has menus, the big glowing orb isn't there, etc.

One thing that was bugging me was that it kept asking to install "Instant Search".  It asked at startup and there was a annoying orange button on each screen asking me to install Instant Search.  I went to go install this Instant Search: turns out it's just a different name for Microsoft's desktop search.

I didn't feel like installing it, but I really didn't want that button asking me to install it.  I found out how to remove it from a comment on this page: [Outlook 2007 & Instant Search](http://thinkersroom.com/bytes/2007/01/07/outlook-2007-instant-search/).  Basically: Tools -> Options -> Other tab -> Advanced Options -> Show prompts to enable Instant Search.
