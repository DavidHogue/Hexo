[Writing for the Web](http://www.idrc.ca/en/ev-48407-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html)


  * Know your target audience
  * Use the "three c's" - be clear, clean, concise
  * Sentences should contain no more than 20 words
  * Limit sentences to one idea per paragraph
  * Limit paragraphs to no more than five lines
  * Follow the "inverted pyramid" - put the most important idea first
  * Use plain and simple language - write the way you speak
  * The active voice; avoid jargon and clich√©s (if you have to use them, spell out acronyms); use strong verbs
  * When appropriate, address the reader personally using words such as "you" or "we"
  * Reduce text by omitting unnecessary words such as "in order to" or "as previously discussed"
  * Increase readability by employing lots of white space and guarding use of different fonts
  * Use meaningful headlines and subheads to break up text and facilitate scanning
  * Avoid long blocks of grey text by using bulleted lists
  * Proofread your document for grammar and spelling mistakes
  * Have a professionsal, a colleague, or a friend take a second look before you publish
